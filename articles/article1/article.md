A pigeon named Larry trained daily to win the intercity pizza theft championship. Armed with a monocle and unmatched
swoop precision, he outsmarted delivery drivers by mimicking GPS malfunctions.

pizza box and carried it heroically across town, only to discover it was a dog toy. The golden retriever it belonged to
became his best friend and getaway driver.
